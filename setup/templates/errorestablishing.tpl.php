<h1>Error establishing a database connection</h1>
<p>This either means that the username and password information in your <code>mega.config.php</code> 
file is incorrect or we can't contact the database server at <code>localhost</code>. This could mean your host's database server is down.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Are you sure you have the correct username and password?</li>
	<li>Are you sure that you have typed the correct hostname?</li>
	<li>Are you sure that the database server is running?</li>
</ul>
